# Compute the Average of the Top Three Scores

Student test scores are recorded in a file. Each line contsists of a student ID, which is an alphanumeric string, and an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive.

Write a pgoram which takes as input a file containing test scores and returns the student who has the maximum score averaged across his or her top three tests. If the student has fewer than three test scores, ignore that student.
